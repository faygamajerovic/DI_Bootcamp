# The game is played on a grid that’s 3 squares by 3 squares.
# Players take turns putting their marks (O or X) in empty squares.
# The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
# When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

# To do this project, you basically need to create four functions:

# display_board() – To display the Tic Tac Toe board (GUI).
# player_input(player) – To get the position from the player.
# check_win() – To check whether there is a winner or not.
# play() – The main function, which calls all the functions created above.
# Note: The 4 functions above are just an example. You can implement many more helper functions or choose a completely different appoach if you want.
